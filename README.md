# Prints
- [eSUN PLA+](https://amzn.to/2LSfA2S)
- Hotend temp: 225C
- Bed temp: 60C (let bed preheat for a bit for better results, glass takes a bit to conduct heat)
- Keep materials in a dry box. I use a SUNLU heated box
- Insure bed is level with the "paper trick" even if you have a BL Touch

# Notes
- Steppers ship with compression brass fittings now, not easily changed out for dual gear
- Check the v-slot wheels to make sure they are smooth when rolling on the axis (X, Y, and Z)
- Run a test calibration cube print to make sure everything comes out well
